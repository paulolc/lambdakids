Quest to empower children with programming skills.

"Lisp isn't a language, it's a building material."
Alan Kay.

As a father and software engineer I firmly believe that in a near future, programming skills will be as important as reading or writing. All future professions and even regular daily tasks will be acomplished using powerful electronic and computerized tools. Which, even with powerful user interfaces, will not reach their maximum potential without being programmed in some way.

Programming is a complex and demanding discipline. As so, it's of high importance to empower them with basic programming, mechanical and electronics skills to kids as earliest age as possible taken into account their age, interests and specific needs.
